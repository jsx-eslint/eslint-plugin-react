## `eslint` Rules

### Markup

Files documenting individual rules live in docs/rules folder. They're annotated
using Markdown, which adds extra layer of legibility and better visual orientation
to the documents. Consider this when writing supporting text for the rules.

See the list below for some guidelines that need to be followed when adding to the
collection.

- Negative adverbs preceding snippets in 'Rule Details' sections must be **bold**.
