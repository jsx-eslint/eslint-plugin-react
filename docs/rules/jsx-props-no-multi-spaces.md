# Disallow multiple spaces between inline JSX props (react/jsx-props-no-multi-spaces)

Enforces that there is exactly one space between all attributes and after tag name and the first attribute in the same line.

**Fixable:** This rule is automatically fixable using the `--fix` flag on the command line.

<App  spacy />

If you are not using JSX or don't care about the space between two props in the same line.

If you have enabled the core rule `no-multi-spaces` with eslint >= 3, you don't need this rule.
