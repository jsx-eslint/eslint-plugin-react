# Prevent duplicate properties in JSX (react/jsx-no-duplicate-props)

Creating JSX elements with duplicate props can cause unexpected behavior in your application.

## Rule Details

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```jsx
<Hello name="John" name="John" />;
```

The following patterns are not considered warnings:

```jsx
<Hello firstname="John" lastname="Doe" />;
```

## Rule Options

```js
...
"react/jsx-no-duplicate-props": [<enabled>, { "ignoreCase": <boolean> }]
...
