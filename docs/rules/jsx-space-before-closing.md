# Validate spacing before closing bracket in JSX (react/jsx-space-before-closing)

**Deprecation notice**: This rule is deprecated. Please use the `"beforeSelfClosing"` option of the [jsx-tag-spacing](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-tag-spacing.md) rule instead.

Enforce or forbid spaces before the closing bracket of self-closing JSX elements.

**Fixable:** This rule is automatically fixable using the `--fix` flag on the command line.
