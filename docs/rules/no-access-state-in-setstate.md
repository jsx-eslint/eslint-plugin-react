# Prevent using this.state within a this.setState (react/no-access-state-in-setstate)

This rule should prevent usage of `this.state` inside `setState` calls.
Such usage of `this.state` might result in errors when two state calls are
called in batch and thus referencing old state and not the current
state. An example can be an increment function:

```javascript
function increment() {
  this.setState({value: this.state.value + 1});
}
```

If two `setState` operations are grouped together in a batch, they both evaluate the old state. Given that `state.value` is 1:

```javascript
this.setState({value: this.state.value + 1}) // 2
this.setState({value: this.state.value + 1}) // 2, not 3
```

This can be avoided with using callbacks which takes the previous state as first argument:

```javascript
function increment() {
  this.setState(prevState => ({value: prevState.value + 1}));
}
```

Then react will call the argument with the correct and updated state, even when things happen in batches. And the example above will be something like:

```javascript
setState({value: 1 + 1})
setState({value: 2 + 1})
```
