# Restrict file extensions that may contain JSX (jsx-filename-extension)

## Rule Details

The following pattern is considered a warning:

```jsx
// filename: MyComponent.js
function MyComponent() {
  return <div />;
}
```

The following pattern is not considered a warning:

```jsx
// filename: MyComponent.jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return <div />;
}
```

## Rule Options

The set of allowed extensions is configurable. By default '.jsx' is allowed. If you wanted to allow both '.jsx' and '.js', the configuration would be:

```js
"rules": {
  "react/jsx-filename-extension": [1, { "extensions": [".js", ".jsx"] }],
}
```

## When Not To Use It

If you don't care about restricting the file extensions that may contain JSX.
