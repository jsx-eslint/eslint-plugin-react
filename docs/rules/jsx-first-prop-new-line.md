# Configure the position of the first property (react/jsx-first-prop-new-line)

Ensure correct position of the first property.

**Fixable:** This rule is automatically fixable using the `--fix` flag on the command line. However, fix does not include indentation. Please rerun lint to correct those errors.

## Rule Details

This rule checks whether the first property of all JSX elements is correctly placed. There are the possible configurations:

* `always`: The first property should always be placed on a new line.
* `never` : The first property should never be placed on a new line, e.g. should always be on the same line as the Component opening tag.
* `multiline`: The first property should always be placed on a new line when the JSX tag takes up multiple lines.
* `multiline-multiprop`: The first property should always be placed on a new line if the JSX tag takes up multiple lines and there are multiple properties. This is the `default` value.
